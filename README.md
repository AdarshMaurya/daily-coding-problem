Daily coding problems.

Inside the project you find: problems, solutions, test folders.  
 
  problems folder consists of interfaces which takes some input as parameters and return some values as output.  
  solution folder consists of classes which implements the problems in problems folder.  
  test folder consists of classes for testing the solutions classes' implementation for problems' in problems folder.  

## Problem 1
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

## Problem 2
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
